The Microsoft SQL provider for the [Durable Task Framework](https://github.com/Azure/durabletask) (DTFx) and [Azure Durable Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview) is a storage provider that persists all task hub state in a Microsoft SQL database, which can be hosted in the cloud or in your own infrastructure.

The key benefits of this storage provider include:

* **Data portability**: This provider supports both Microsoft SQL Server and Azure SQL Database. Microsoft SQL Server is supported by all major cloud providers and can also be run in your own infrastructure. Because the data is stored in a single database, you can also easily backup the data and migrate it in a new server or service as necessary.

* **Data control**: You have full control over the database, the logins, and have direct access to the runtime data, making it easy to protect and secure as necessary. Microsoft SQL also has great support for encryption and business continuity, ensuring that any apps you build can meet the compliance requirements of your enterprise.

* **Multitenancy**: Multiple applications can share the same database in a way that isolates the data between each app using low-privilege SQL login credentials.

* **3rd party app integrations**: This provider comes with a set of stored procedures, SQL functions, and views that allow you to easily integrate Durable orchestrations and entities into your existing SQL-based applications.
